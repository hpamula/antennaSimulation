1. Electric fields are generated by electric charges
2. Magnetic fields are generated by electric currents

The electromagnetic field detected at a given point in space is just the time-delayed effect of the position, velocity and acceleration of a charge, at an earlier time!

Points send information about their position, velocity(speed+direction) and acceleration

All electromagnetic fields in the universe are 100% just the results of receiving out-of-date status updates about the position, velocity and acceleration of charges.
There's no causation no interaction between electric and magnetic fields at all!
